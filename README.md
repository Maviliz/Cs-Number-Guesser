# Cs-Number-Guesser
Number Guesser but in C#.

Created in Visual Studio Community. This console application generates a random 4-digit number, prompts the user for a 4-digit number guess, checks if the guess is the right length and contains only number characters, grades the user's guess and prompts for subsequent guesses until the user guesses correctly or a max attempt count is reached.
